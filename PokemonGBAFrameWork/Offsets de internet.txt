As most of you may know, the female protagonist shares the same colour palette to that of the male protagonist, however hidden in the ROM is an unused palette that appears to match the male protagonist's palette but with one difference, the background colour (Colour index 00) is green instead of purple. This may have been intended to be used for the female protagonist. The offset for the palette can be found at 0x035B988.
Unused Professor Oak Sprite

At offset 0x03CA770 there appears to be what looks like a sprite of an older version of Professor Oak, it closely resembles the sprite for Professor Birch in Pokémon Ruby.
Player and Rival Name Data

At 0x001C574F is the "New Name" text for your rival and suggested rival names in addition to the names which are selected for the player when they hit "Start" on the name entry screen with a blank name.

This is the complete dump of what's at that offset:
NEW NAME GREEN RED LEAF FIRE GARY KAZ TORU ASH KENE GEKI JAK JANNE JONN KAMON KARL TAYLOR OSCAR HIRO MAX JON RALPH KAY TOSH ROAK OMI JODI AMANDA HILLARY MAKEY MICHI PAULA JUNE CASSIE REY SEDA KIKO MINA NORIE SAI MOMO SUZI
The possible randomizer names for the protagonist are as follows

Boy	Girl
RED	RED
FIRE	FIRE
ASH	OMI
KENE	JODI
GEKI	AMANDA
JAK	HILLARY
JANNE	MAKEY
JONN	MICHI
KAMON	PAULA
KARL	JUNE
TAYLOR	CASSIE
OSCAR	REY
HIRO	SEDA
MAX	KIKO
JON	MINA
RALPH	NORIE
KAY	SAI
TOSH	MOMO
ROAK	SUZI

LEAF appears to be unused in Fire Red, but is one of the protagonist suggestions in Leaf Green which uses the same name list in the same order, but at a different offset. GREEN, GARY, KAZ, and TORU are the options given to the player for naming their rival. Pressing "Start" when entering a blank "New Name" for the rival appears to always result in the rival's name being selected as GREEN.
